# ChromePlay
Chrome plugin for controlling media from browser 

ChromePlay is plugin for those who love to listen to music while browsing through interesting articles, blog posts, working on solving problems, or just passing time over internet. It lets you keep track of your favorite songs and playlists while you do your browsing and provides you options for Play/Pause, shuffling through tracks and choosing playlists from your music account. 
The problem we are trying to solve here is the irritating effort customer has to put in each time he/she wants to change a song in the playlist while browsing through websites. ChromePlay helps reducing switches between music applications, thus letting you focus only in on your work.
